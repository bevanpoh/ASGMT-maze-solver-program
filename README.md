# Repository Info

This repository contains work done for my Data Structures & Algorithms Module Assignment 2 at SP
This assignment was a group project with one other classmate
The scope of the assignment consisted of developing a program with object-oriented design principles that
1. uses various maze-solving algorithms to search for a path through a square grid of walls and paths
2. visualises the paths that each algorithm finds using the standard library Turtle,

- `classes` contains the python code for the classes developed for the program
- `test_maps` contains the maps used to test the program in .txt format
    - "X" - means a wall
    - "." - means a cell that can be occupied
- `main.py` contains the main python program to run the command-line interface
