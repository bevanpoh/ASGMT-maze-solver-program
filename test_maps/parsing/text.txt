"A bottomless curse, a bottomless sea. Source of all greatness, all things that be. 
A call to the bloodless, wherever they be. Fix your ears to hear our calls; 
Kos, we have beckoned and Kos is dead. Forgive us and curse upon the fiends."
"Curse the Fiends, their Children too... And their Children, forever true..."
